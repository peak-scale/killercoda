Now you have learned the basics of OpenTofu. You will now apply this know-how for your first simple module. The first
thing we now need to do is to think about what we want to achieve and how we can abstract this into a configuration. We
will layout the concept and then you start implementing the solution. When you hit check, the scenario is finished.

# Vision

You have a dedicated cluster and many different developer teams, which would like to work with Kubernetes. You want to
share the cluster with all these developers. The logical abstraction you would like to use is a `Tenant`. A tenant
orchestrates multiple namespaces and users. Also for each namespaces there's the necessary resources in place to make it
secure, such a NetworkPolicies, Rolebindings and ResourceQuotas.

You are asked to create a module, which can be used to create tenants on Kubernetes. The module should be reusable and
should be able to be used in different clusters. The tenants are defined in a single YAML file.

# Making a concept

Think about what abstractions we can make:

* `Tenant`: Is the highest logical abstraction in our scenario. It does not translate to a resource, however should hold
  relevant information:
  * `Metdata`:
    * `Users`: Define Groups/Users having access to this tenant
    * `Quota` ResourceQuota for each namespace
    * `Namespaces`: All the namespaces belonging to a tenant are defined here
  * [`Namespace`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/): Namespace is the logic
    abstraction we will be using on Kubernetes. It provides the necessary boundaries on the platform.
    * [`NetworkPolicy`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/): We use
      NetworkPolicies per namespace to restrict any access to other namespaces.
    * [`Role/Rolebinding`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/): We will use the metadata of
      the tenant to create grant access to the defined users
    * [`ResourceQuota`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/): we will the metadata of the tenant
      to create resourcequotas for each namespace.

We have one other requirement:

* The tenants should be easily manageable, your consumers would prefer YAML files where they can request

## Thinking in modules

We should think about where we can make modules and reuse code.

* `Tenant`: We can create a module for the tenant, which will create all the necessary resources for a tenant. This
  module should be reusable and should be able to be used in different clusters.
* `Namespace`: We can create a module for the namespace, which will create all the necessary resources for a namespace.
  This module should be reusable and should be able to be used in different clusters. Within this module we will also
  create all relevant namespaced resources for each namespace. The namespace module should be used in the tenant module.

## User-facing API/Data

I always like to start with the data structure, which the users I am building the solution for are consuming. You
probably can't make the perfect abstraction from the start. Therefor keep in mind that it's always good to iterate on
the abstraction.

Based on the above concept we have made above I would envision a following yaml structure:

**tenant.yaml**

```yaml
# For the permissions we need to know Who we are granting access to and what kind of access of property we are using (Username/Groups)
name: "<tenantname>"

permissions:
  - name: "<groupname/username>"
    kind: "Group/User"

# The Quota is a 1:1 abstraction of the resourceQuota object from Kubernetes
quota:

# Declares the namespaces which are assigned to this tenant
namespaces:
  - namespace-1
  - namespace-2
```

## Verify Provider Capabilities

Before getting your hands dirty, let's look if there's providers which can achieve what we need. In our case we mainly
need to take a look at
the [Kubernetes Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs).

# Your Task

1. Create a YAML file `tenant.yaml` which holds a structure, where easily one or more tenants can be added or removed.
   You can also create multiple files if you prefer.

2. Write a module for one tenant which creates the necessary resources for a tenant. The module should be reusable and
   should be able to be used in different clusters.

3. Rollout the tenants against the existing cluster in your environment

Go to the next step when you are satisfied with your solution (you may also copy your progress to your client for
further use)

Here are tenant specifications you can use:

```yaml
# Tenant 1
name: "tenant1"
permissions:
  - name: "group1"
    kind: "Group"
    role: "owner"
  - name: "user1"
    kind: "User"
    role: "read-only"
quota:
  requests.cpu: "4"
  requests.memory: "16Gi"
  limits.cpu: "8"
  limits.memory: "32Gi"
namespaces:
  - "namespace-1"
  - "namespace-2"

# Tenant 2
name: "tenant2"
permissions:
  - name: "group2"
    kind: "Group"
    role: "administrator"
  - name: "user2"
    kind: "User"
    role: "read-only"
quota:
  requests.cpu: "2"
  requests.memory: "8Gi"
  limits.cpu: "4"
  limits.memory: "16Gi"
namespaces:
  - "namespace-3"
  - "namespace-4"
```
